              We provide extensive tooling such as post management, comment
              management, video analytics as well as personalized inspiration
              videos. We are a horizontal team as we touch upon all stages of
              the lifecycle of a Tiktok video, from creation, management,
              deletion and appeal... Therefore cross-team collaboration is
              guaranteed in all projects.

              As for tech stack, Tiktok has huge amounts of traffic so we adopt
              a microservice architecture. Hence I am familiar with most key
              components of a distributed system, such as Message Queues,
              Consul, Kubernetes, Docker etc... As for observability, we work
              with Grafana and an internal log aggregation platform similar to
              Open Telemetry
