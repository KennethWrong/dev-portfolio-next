I'm using design patterns as a way to learn more about Java and other OO P languages to better understanding the semantics, keywords and behaviours. So I am going to write about design patterns as well as OOP principles

## Chapter 1: The strategy pattern

**The Strategy pattern** - Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and make them interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.

Identify the part of your application that constantly changes and separate it from the parts that stay the same.

### Components
**Context** - Holds an abstract strategy field and calls the function that is exposed.

**Strategy** - An abstract class with a function that will be implemented by the concrete implementation.

**Concrete Strategy** - A class that is a concrete implementation of stragey abstract class.

Design around interface, not implementation. A strong emphasis on flexibility and change as we can hot swap the stragey within the context with other concrete strategies.

**Abstract Classes**
- Can have both concrete and abstract methods
- Can include fields
- Classes can only inherit 1 abstract class
- Can’t be instantiated by itself
>

**Interface**
- Can only have abstract methods
- Cannot include fields
- Classes can inherit multiple interfaces
- Can’t be instantiated by itself
>

**Design Principe**
- Favour composition over inheritance
- Encapsulate what varies
- Program to interfaces, not implementations
